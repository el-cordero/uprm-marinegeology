Elvin Cordero

I'm a PhD student in Geological Oceanography at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayag√ºez. With a strong foundation in data analysis and GIS applications, I leverage technology to visualize and interpret geological data, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of marine environments. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of marine systems and their importance to global environmental health, aiming to make a positive impact through research, education, and advocacy.
